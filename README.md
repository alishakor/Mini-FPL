# Mini Fantasy Premier League
> Competing with fans to ascertain the best soccer manager

# Project Description

- A Mini FPL is a game where soccer fans can create their own imaginary soccer teams using real players from the English Premier League. You get a budget to buy players, and you need to choose the best players within that budget. Then, you compete with other fans' teams based on how well your selected players perform in real-life soccer matches.

- You can make changes to your team, like trading players or choosing a team captain to earn more points. As the real soccer season progresses, you earn points based on your players' goals, assists, clean sheets, and other actions in actual matches. Points are also deducted when you are penalized or when you miss a penalty. 

- The goal is to build the highest-scoring team and climb the leaderboard, competing with your friends or other fans to see who has the best soccer management skills."
